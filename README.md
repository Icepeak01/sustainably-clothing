# OVERVIEW
This project is focused on sales and inventory both during and outside of marketing campaigns for a clothing firm. We have received sustainable data for a clothing store known as sustainable apparel. The data covers the period of about 5 months and the fields includes product category, product price and the firm sales record during and after some marketing campaigns carried out.

The objective is to prepare/insert the data, analyze and answer some thought provoking questions using SQL, and subsequently outline the results that would enhance decision making capabilities and boost profits for the apparel store. The objectives was achieved by;

1. Data Collection
2. Database Creation
3. Table Creation and Inserting Values
4. ERD set up


Top questions answered are:
1. How many transactions were completed during each marketing campaign?
2. Which product had the highest sales quantity?
3. What is the total revenue generated from each marketing campaign?
4. What is the top-selling product category based on the total revenue generated?
5. Which products had a higher quantity sold compared to the average quantity sold?
6. What is the average revenue generated per day during the marketing campaigns?
7. What is the percentage contribution of each product to the total revenue?

### Data Collection
The project's dataset came from an internet data storage source. There were three distinct tables in the dataset, each containing different data that needed to be entered. The three distint tables are;
  1. marketing campaign: This table has 5 columns which are campaign_id, campaign_name, product_id, start_date, end_date and has 3 rows
  2. Transactions: this table consist of 4 columns transaction_id, product_id, quantity, purchase_date, and has 64 unique transactions.
  3. sustainable clothing: This table also has 5 columns which are product_id, product_name, category, size, price and 20 uique products.
